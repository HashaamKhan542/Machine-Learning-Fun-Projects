# IoT Sensor Data Processing and Analysis

This project showcases basic data processing techniques for **sensor data**, using Python. It includes data simulation, dictionary-based data structuring, conditional filtering, and random scenario analysis.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to:
- Generate random sensor readings (temperature and humidity)
- Create structured sensor data using Python dictionaries
- Filter and rank sensors based on temperature thresholds
- Handle invalid/missing data
- Simulate air quality categories and recommend activities accordingly
- Visualize category frequencies as dictionary-style summaries

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- `random` module
- `hashlib` for sensor ID generation
- Dictionary operations
- Function design and simulation logic

---

## ðŸ§ª Key Tasks

### Q1. **Create Sensor Data Variables**
- Generate 5 unique sensor IDs using hashing
- Create random temperature (Â°C) and humidity (%) values
- Print and validate all data

### Q2. **Create Sensor Data Dictionary and Filter Top Temperatures**
- Combine readings into a nested dictionary
- Write a function to:
  - Filter sensors above a given temperature
  - Sort them in descending order
  - Print top 3 sensors with the highest temperatures

### Q3. **Air Quality Analysis and Recommendations**
- Simulate 10 random air quality levels: `'Good'`, `'Moderate'`, `'Unhealthy'`, `'Hazardous'`
- Count and calculate the percentage of each category
- Provide activity recommendations based on air quality

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output (Simplified)

```python
Sensor IDs: ['a1b2c3d4e5', ...]
Temperature Readings: [23.4, 31.2, ...]
Humidity Levels: [55.6, 78.9, ...]

Top 3 Sensors:
Sensor X | Temp: 45.1Â°C | Humidity: 67.2%

Air Quality Summary:
{'Good': 20%, 'Unhealthy': 30%, ...}
