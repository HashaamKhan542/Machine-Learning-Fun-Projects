# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository!  
This repo contains a collection of tasks, mini-projects, and applied exercises that demonstrate my understanding of machine learning concepts using Python.

Each task is organized in its own folder with:
- 📘 A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation
- 📄 A `README.md` explaining the task and outcome
- 💻 Code focused on real-world data processing, modeling, and analysis

---

## 🚀 What's Inside

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [2.1 - Sensor Data Processing](./2.1) | Simulates sensor data (temperature/humidity), filters based on conditions, and handles air quality analysis |
| [2.2 - XYZ Task Name](./2.2) | [.... ] |
| [2.3 - ...] | [Adding as i go] |

> 💡 New tasks will be added regularly as I continue building my portfolio.
